name: github-prune
description: Sub-skill of `github`. Audit and remove stale git worktrees, local branches, and remote (origin) branches that are already merged into dev, protecting anything with uncommitted changes. Honors the parent Output Contract.
---

# Operation: prune

**Goal.** Remove stale worktrees and branches (local + origin) already merged into `dev`,
protecting anything dirty. Obey the parent **Output Contract**: silent run, errors as they
occur, one concise summary.

---

## Step 1 — Verify dev exists

```bash
git branch --list dev
git branch -r --list origin/dev
```

Missing locally or on origin → stop; without `dev` there is no merge base for "stale".

---

## Step 2 — Fetch, prune, detect merge strategy

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
git log dev --merges --max-count=10 --oneline
```

- Fewer than 2 merge commits → `MERGE_STRATEGY=squash` (use `git cherry`).
- Several merge commits → `MERGE_STRATEGY=standard` (use `--merged` / `--is-ancestor`).

---

## Step 3 — Categorize worktrees, local branches, remote branches

Parse `git worktree list --porcelain` (skip the first/main entry). Exclude `dev`, `main`,
`master`, `origin/HEAD`, and any branch checked out in a worktree.

**Merged check:**
- *standard:* `git merge-base --is-ancestor <HEAD> dev` (exit 0 = merged), or
  `git branch --merged dev` / `git branch -r --merged dev`.
- *squash:* `git cherry dev <branch>` — every line starts with `-` (and non-empty) = merged;
  any `+` line, or empty output, = keep.

**Dirty check** (worktrees): `git -C <path> status --porcelain` — any output = dirty.

Categorize: merged + clean → stale (deletion candidate); merged + dirty → blocked (never
delete); not merged → active (ignore).

---

## Step 4 — Present and confirm

Show a grouped list (worktrees / local branches / remote branches) plus a "blocked — dirty"
section. If nothing is stale, say so and stop. Otherwise `AskUserQuestion`: delete all listed,
or exclude some (follow up with a multi-select of items to **keep**). Confirm the final list.

---

## Step 5 — Delete (worktrees → local → remote)

```bash
git worktree remove <path>            # retry with --force if the branch is checked out there
git branch -d <branch>                # safe delete only; never silently escalate to -D
git push origin --delete <branch>     # strip the origin/ prefix
```

Track each result (success / failure with stderr). Apply the **Windows worktree-lock footgun**
rule from the parent skill if a worktree dir resists removal.

---

## Step 6 — Summary (only expected output)

```
Removed 3 (worktree feat/login + its local & remote branch). Skipped 1 dirty (fix/wip). Failed 0.
```

Write no audit file. Git history is the archive of record for what was deleted; a tracked log
would only restate it, and would land as an uncommitted file on `dev` every run.
