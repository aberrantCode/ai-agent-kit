Stage all changes, pull latest (merging any conflicts), commit, and push to remote.

Follow these steps exactly and in order. Do not skip steps or ask for confirmation unless a merge conflict requires a decision.

## Step 1 — Inspect current state

Run these in parallel:
- `git status` — identify untracked, modified, and deleted files
- `git log --oneline -5` — understand recent commit message style
- `git diff HEAD` — review all unstaged changes

Report a brief summary of what you find before continuing.

## Step 2 — Stage all changes

Run:
```
git add -A
```

Then run `git status` to confirm everything is staged. Warn the user if any sensitive-looking files (`.env`, credentials, secrets) are about to be committed and pause for confirmation before continuing.

## Step 3 — Pull latest from remote

Run:
```
git pull --no-rebase
```

If the pull succeeds cleanly, continue to Step 4.

**If merge conflicts occur:**
1. Run `git diff --diff-filter=U` to list conflicted files
2. Read each conflicted file
3. Resolve conflicts by keeping the most complete/correct version of each section — prefer incoming changes for new features, local changes for in-progress work
4. Stage the resolved files with `git add <file>`
5. Run `git status` to confirm all conflicts are resolved
6. Continue to Step 4

**If the pull fails for any other reason** (e.g. no remote, diverged history), report the error clearly and stop. Do not force-push or reset.

## Step 4 — Commit

Draft a commit message based on `git diff HEAD~1..HEAD` (to see what changed vs last commit) and the staged diff:
- Use conventional commit format: `type: short description`
- Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Add a short body (2-4 bullets) if the change spans multiple concerns

Create the commit using a HEREDOC to preserve formatting:
```
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<your message here>
EOF
)"
```

## Step 5 — Push

Run:
```
git push
```

If the push is rejected because the remote has new commits (non-fast-forward after a failed pull), report the error and stop — do not force-push.

## Step 6 — Report

Print a summary:
- Files staged
- Merge conflicts resolved (if any)
- Commit hash and message (`git log --oneline -1`)
- Push result
